    <p>We try to give you example projects as a good starting point for your very own Citrus testing project.</p>

    <p>The Citrus sample applications try to demonstrate how Citrus works in different integration test scenarios. The projects are executable with Maven
      and should give you a detailed picture how Citrus testing works.</p>

    <p>Please have a look at the repository on <b><a href="https://github.com/christophd/citrus-samples" target="_blank">citrus-samples</a></b>. There you can find all our sample projects.</p>

    <p>Each sample demonstrates a special aspect of how to use Citrus. Most of the samples use a simple <b><a href="todo-app">todo-list</a></b> application as
      system under test. Please find following list of samples and their primary objective</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style="width: 15em;">Name</th>
          <th align="center">Objective</th>
          <th align="center">Source code</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {% for post in site.categories.samples %}
        <tr>
          <td><a href="{{ post.permalink }}">{{ post.sample }}</a></td>
          <td align="center">{{ post.description }}</td>
          <td align="center"><a href="https://github.com/christophd/citrus-samples/blob/master/{{ post.sample }}" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pencil"></i></a></td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Pick your sample application for try out and got to the respective folder. Each sample is executable on your host. You just need Maven, Java and a git client.
      Refer to the detailed instructions in the sample <b><a href="https://github.com/christophd/citrus-samples/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README</a></b>.</p>

    <p>Of course we appreciate any kind of help that you can give us in order to make things easy for Citrus users. So if you have
      a sample worth reading for others please let us know. Also if you are missing a sample because you do not know how to accomplish the Citrus
      use case please do not hesitate to contact us. You may also open a new issue in the <b><a href="https://github.com/christophd/citrus-samples/issues" target="_blank">Citrus samples</a></b> repository.</p>
